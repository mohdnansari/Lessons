1) Zip and unzip utilities will have to be installed on Ubuntu machine.
    ** sudo apt-get update
    ** sudo apt-get install zip
2) The demonstrator is running things on MacOS. it is quite possible that in some places steps are slightly different that what are shown.
3) buildAndDeploy -> is buildAndDeploy.sh on ubunut. renama and chmod if needed.
4) The prompt for fonts, does not work. On seeing this,  Run the script all over again and the prompt will not be there anymore.

5) NOTE: after running the second setup script, we need to clone the zerotobc repository and run chapter03 scripts to bring up needed infrastructure.

NOTE NOTE NOTE: 
1) Reboot is required between STEP1 and STEP2 and STEP2 and STEP3. i.e. after running the first curl command, reboot. after running the second 
curl command, REBOOT. then run buildAndDeploy.sh
2) External IP of GCE changes everytime it is rebooted/restarted


Sample:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y curl
curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rddill-IBM/ZeroToBlockchain/master/setup_Ubuntu_Part_1.sh | bash

**REBOOT**

curl -H 'Accept: application/vnd.github.v3.raw' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rddill-IBM/ZeroToBlockchain/master/setup_Ubuntu_Part_2.sh | bash

**REBOOT**

now clone the Zerotoblockchain repository in the root : 
                  git clone https://github.com/rddill-IBM/ZeroToBlockchain.git
                  
                  
rename buildAndDeploy to buildAndDeploy.sh(because we are on ubuntu), then run it
Note: this will not run if the instance was not rebooted after completion of the last CURL command.
