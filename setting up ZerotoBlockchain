1) Zip and unzip utilities will have to be installed on Ubuntu machine.
    ** sudo apt-get update
    ** sudo apt-get install zip
2) The demonstrator is running things on MacOS. it is quite possible that in some places steps are slightly different that what are shown.
3) buildAndDeploy -> is buildAndDeploy.sh on ubunut. renama and chmod if needed.
4) The prompt for fonts, does not work. On seeing this,  Run the script all over again and the prompt will not be there anymore.

5) NOTE: after running the second setup script, we need to clone the zerotobc repository and run chapter03 scripts to bring up needed infrastructure.

NOTE NOTE NOTE: Reboot is required between STEP1 and STEP2 and STEP2 and STEP3. i.e. after running the first curl command, reboot. after running the second 
curl command, REBOOT. then run buildAndDeploy.sh
