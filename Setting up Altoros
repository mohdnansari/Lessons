Deploying Altoros 4 node blockchain network:

Why the deployment may not work? Important pointers:
1) The cloud instances on GCE have external IP addresses that keep changing by default. The altoros example needs us to define the exact IP addresses at the time of configuration.

2) All exported environment variables are lost when the cloud instance terminal is closed or logged off. This applies specifically to the following env variables:
fabric/bin in PATH
IPs of all 4 nodes 
GOPATH etc

for permanently storing env variables across logout/login, use ~/.profile to store all such env variables permanently

3) #NO # Fabric images(1.1) need NOT be present and correctly tagged for the altoros example to work.


4) ###IMPORTANT###
   Use the command "sudo ./network.sh -m generate -o a" to generate peer artifacts. The documentation uses "generate-peer" keyword instead.
        ** Not sure if this is correct. but using this for now. **
